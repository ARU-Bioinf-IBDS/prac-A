    "# Introducing Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is an \"open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text\" (http://jupyter.org/). Juypter notebooks are really useful for scientists because they make \"data analysis easier to record, understand and reproduce\" as explained in this [Nature Article: *Interactive notebooks: Sharing the code*](http://doi.org/10.1038/515151a). Note that the article discusses Juypter Notebooks using their original name \"IPython Notebooks\". I use Jupyter Notebook in my research, for instance including \n",
