## Getting Started Instructions using Microsoft Azure Notebooks
[![Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.png)](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/ARU-Bioinformatics/ibds10-jupyter-intro/)

To clone the practical directly to your Microsoft Azure account just click the 'launch' badge above.

Once you have cloned the practical then click on the ? notebook to run it.

## Getting Started Instructions using Anaconda 

To use the practical with Anaconda installed on your computer,
click on the green 'Clone or download' button above.
You will see a pop-up window with a button 'Download ZIP'. Click on it. 
The notebooks and data files will be downloaded as a compressed archive: a file with extension `.zip`.
The archive will be in the folder where your web browser usually puts downloaded files.
You will need to double-click on the downloaded file to uncompress it, 
although your browser may have already done that automatically for you.

Then run **jupyter-notebook** and open the ibds10-jupyter-intro.
