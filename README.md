# Introducing Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebook is an "open-source web application that allows you 
to create and share documents that contain live Python code, equations,
visualizations and narrative text" (http://jupyter.org/). 
This means that you can write Python code in your web browser 
(Chrome, Safari, Firefox) and mix in human readable text.

Juypter notebooks are really useful for scientists because
they make "data analysis easier to record, understand and reproduce" 
as explained in this
[Nature Article: Interactive notebooks: Sharing the code
](http://doi.org/10.1038/515151a). 
Note that the article discusses Juypter Notebooks 
using their original name "IPython Notebooks". 
I use Jupyter Notebook in my research, for instance 
including [a notebook containing data analysis and graph plotting
](https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798318002541/ba5278sup3.html), 
as part of a
[research paper](https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798318002541).

## Getting Started Instructions using Microsoft Azure Notebooks
[![Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.png)](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/ARU-Bioinformatics/ibdsA-intro/)

To clone the practical directly to your Microsoft Azure account just click the *launch azurenb* icon above.
See Canvas page 
[Introducing Jupyter Notebooks](https://canvas.anglia.ac.uk/courses/1490/pages/p1-introducing-jupyter-notebooks) 
for a work through showing how to do this.

Once you have imported the practical then, in Azure Notebooks, click on the 
**introducing_jupyter_notebooks.ipynb** 
notebook to run it.

## Getting Started Instructions using Anaconda 

To use this practical with Anaconda installed on your computer you will need to first download it:

[<img src="images/download_zip.png" alt="Download zip" width="50px"/>](https://github.com/ARU-Bioinformatics/ibdsA-intro/archive/master.zip)

* Click on the *Download zip* icon above†.
* Once the file has downloaded, unzip the file†. 
* Move the **ibdsA-intro** folder created to where you want to work. 
* Start Jupyter Notebook†.
* Then run **jupyter-notebook** and open the 
  **introducing_jupyter_notebooks.ipynb** 
  notebook by clicking on it.
