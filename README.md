### Practical P1: Intro to Python for Bioinformatics

* This practical introduces programming in python showing how sequence information can be stored and manipulated in strings.
* The practical uses Jupyter notebooks and can be used either using:
  * Microsoft Azure Notebooks - this is an online free service for anyone to develop and run code in their browser using Jupyter. See Azure Notebooks is a free service for anyone to develop and run code in their browser using Jupyter. 
  * Installing Anaconda on your computer and downloading the practical (see below).


## Getting Started Instructions using Microsoft Azure Notebooks
[![Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.png)](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/ARU-Bioinformatics/ARU-IntroToBioinformatics-P1/)

To clone the practical directly to your Microsoft Azure account just click the 'launch' badge above.

Once you have cloned the practical then start by looking at the [Guide to Practical P1: Intro to Python for Bioinformatics](./0_practical_P1_guide.ipynb).

## Instructions (Anaconda and CoCalc)

To use the notebooks and data files for the course,
click on the green 'Clone or download' button above.
You will see a pop-up window with a button 'Download ZIP'. Click on it. 
The notebooks and data files will be downloaded as a compressed archive: a file with extension `.zip`.
The archive will be in the folder where your web browser usually puts downloaded files.
You will need to double-click on the downloaded file to uncompress it, 
although your browser may have already done that automatically for you.

Then run jupyter-notebook and open the [Guide to Practical P1: Intro to Python for Bioinformatics](./0_practical_P1_guide.ipynb).
